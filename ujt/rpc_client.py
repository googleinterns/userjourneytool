""" Module providing access points for RPCs to the reporting server. 

Although we can directly expose the reporting_service_stub, seems like
a better design to provide an abstraction layer on top of it. 
These functions are 1:1 passthroughs right now, but we may need to do
some additional data processing as the application grows.
